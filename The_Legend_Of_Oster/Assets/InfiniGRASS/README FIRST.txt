NOTE 1: 
A LWRP Beta version of the main shader is included in "Version 1.9" -> "1.9.7 LWRP-URP Shader Beta" folder. Decompress the file and replace 
the shader with this one in grass materials to use in LWRP. This is WIP and in Beta phase, so please report any issue that may come up so i
can address in next versions.

NOTE2:
If experience an issue where cannot paint grass in editor and not see the white painting circle, please reset the Unity layout to Default 
to address the issue. Also make sure only one Inspector window is running in Unity.
