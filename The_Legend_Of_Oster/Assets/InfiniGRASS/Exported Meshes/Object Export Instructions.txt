1. Paint grass in editor or in real time

2. Choose a big static group members count so all grass will go in the same group

3. After the grass patch is painted, while in play mode select the batched mesh (or meshes if it was split in 64K vertices) 

4. Goto file - expoort wavefront object and click to save to the selected directory

5. Exit play mode, insert object in scene, rotate the root of the object 180 degress and it will move to the proper place

6. Apply the relevant material the grass had and now the grass patch can be used independetly of the InfiniGRASS system

7. NOTE: The grass area should be kept low, so a LOD system can be applied to the patches (a simple cutoff based on camera distance for example) 

8. NOTE 2: The fading based on camera will still work, so the LOD cutoff may fade for a smooth grass vannishing
