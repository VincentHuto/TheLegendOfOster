The skybox prefab can be converted to work with Unity 5 with the below steps:

1. Click on the SkyboxMat property in SkyMasterManager script of the prefab that uses the skybox, 
to move to the material folder (or go to SkyMaster/Version1.5/Materials/Skybox folder)

2. Locate the "Skybox-Procedural_SkyMaster Unity5" material and drag it to the SkyMasterManager 
script in "SkyboxMat" parameter

3. Click on the "Unity 5" toggle option in the SkyMasterManager script

4. Assing "1" in the Cam_follow_factor option, this is required for the Unity 5 shader in order 
to keep the sky steady when the camera height changes. A different number can also be used to give 
a latency effect as the hight changes.

The rest is automated and should work right away with the proper Unity 5 sky shader and settings. 
The package in "_UNITY5 UPDATE" folder also contains a demo scene with this setup ready, for reference.
This scene is for demo purposes.



The required tags in Unity 4 are added automatically, in Unity 5 the tags must be inserted manually.

List of the tags that need to go in the project

Conductor (for attracting lightning)
Flammable (for cathcing fire/ice)
