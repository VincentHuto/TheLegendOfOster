The system provides a range of ready to use prefabs, based on the individual project needs.

MOBILE FASTEST SKYDOME

- This prefab is using the standard skydome approach. The new mobile
oriented assets of version 1.5 are used and particles are set low.
This prefab used with the skybox in v1.5 should provide the fastet performance.
The procedure to use the skybox mode is described in detail in the Sky Master GUIDE.


MOBILE SKYBOX

- This prefab is using the new in v1.5 skybox approach. It uses the standard assets
of the PC prefab with a lower particle count. Use for higher end mobile systems.


NOTE: In general particle effects are heavy on mobile, so heavy cloud simulation should be 
limited and cloud systems should be used one each time, depending on the mobile specs.
The volumetric cloud bed takes only one draw call and can give good results even with
low particle counts.

REALISTIC Heavy

- This is the standard prefab, enchanced for more realistic cloud speeds. This is suggested for
use in mid to higher end PCs and has all effects available. GI Proxy is setup also, but disabled
by default.

REALISTIC light

- A lighter version of the above prefab, with less particles and dynamic particle and gameobject particle 
systems
