---------- URP Beta quick instructions ----------

Start by inserting the "UniversalRP-HighQuality" in Project Settings - Graphics - Scriptable Render Pipeline Settings slot. This will enable
the pipeline where the required renderer features have been defined.

The URP system includes a volume fog ("connectSunToVolumeFogURP"), sun shafts ("connectSunToSunShaftsURP") systems and three cloud types, one is shader based (InfiniCLOUD)
and does not require any image effects or pipeline render features.

The other is image effect based volume clouds in background, controlled by "connectSunToVolumeCloudsURP" script on camera.

The other type is full volume with fly through and planet support, controlled by "connectSunToFullVolumeCloudsURP" script on camera. Note that this script also 
includes the above cloud type in one script, and can choose between the two using the "CloudChoice" variable. This latest merged version does not yet support
water reflections, so for water reflections use the "connectSunToVolumeCloudsURP" script.

To get clouds working in other than demo scenes:

Copy a desired effect from any demo camera (or copy camera whole). 

Insert the scene directional light to the scripts (e.g. "connectSunToFullVolumeCloudsURP") from the scene 
in the "sun" slot (and in "sun light" slot as well in full volume clouds script), also enable skybox on camera 
when changing from background volume (0) to full volume (1) clouds, using the CloudChoice variable.

Disable HDR for background volume clouds (HDR works with full volume fly through clouds)
Use Linear color for default coloration.

URP and HDRP versions are in Beta phase and further features and automation on setup are WIP.

Please also refer to the following demo scene, which has all cloud types available and script (in "API EXAMPLES CONTROLLER" object) 
with methods on how to control them in script.

The latest prefab is recommended for direct use (mainly for dekstop usage, refer to first video above).

Drag the prefab named "SKY MASTER v4.2 Prefab - All systems & Volume Lighting LINEAR COLOR" in the scene
after deleting the current directional light and camera. Then camera can be replaced by any other, as
long as it is tagged as "MainCamera" and the one in the prefab is deleted.

If there is a need to keep an existing main camera, then drag the "SKY MASTER v4.9 Prefab - Volume Clouds LINEAR COLOR - Automatic Setup"
prefab in an existing scene and the system will auto configure all modules for this camera. 

For mobile there is a dedicated scene, that will also cover all older mobile phones (SM2.0).
Scene name is "SkyMaster 3 Mobile Water Demo with Sky v3.3" in "EXTRA SM DEMOS AND ASSETS" folder.

Quick Tips:

NOTE 1: Add Volumetric Gradient Fog from Camera FX ("Add Volumetric Fog" button) section BEFORE adding the new Volume Clouds (InfiniCLOUD) to camera and set it up, 
when the step by step configuration is used.

NOTE 2: Add the new Volumetric Clouds (InfiniCLOUD) to camera by inserting "InfiniCLOUD" component in the camera object. Press the buttons to setup. Use after the
main Sky Master ULTIMATE system has been setup.

NOTE 3: If game crashes (actual build of the game) in Unity 2018.2 and above, probably is a Legacy Paricle conponent left in the scene.
Use the included converter in Assets -> Upgrade Legacy Particles, with the scene open to convert the Legacy to Shuriken and solve the issue. Also place 
a material for Lightning before any conversionn, as a lightning line renderer must also be created for the case lightning particles existed in the scene. 
"Lightning Mat 5" is the recommended material to use.

NOTE 4: Volumetric light shadows work with 4 cascades in shadow settings in some Unity versions.

NOTE 5: The system can be setup Step by step using the Configurator (SkyMaster script) or using the prefabs in the PREFABS folder
Use the v3.4 prefabs for older systems and mobiles and the v4.2 with the new clouds for stronger systems. The new clouds are compatible
with mobile as well (enable the WebGL option for that purpose and put the mobile factor to zero)

NOTE 6: The demo scenes can be used to customize and create new prefabs, just drag all items inside the main prefab object and Apply them
in inspector to get a new prefab.

NOTE 7: You may use the WeatherRandomizerSKYMASTER and TimerSKYMASTER scripts, attach them to the skymaster object and trigger random 
weather effects or set precision time. Those can be also used as base templates for scripting the system, they showcase how to change
weather and time of day by setting up the proper variables.

NOTE 8: Add a layer named "Background " before setting up blending of back layer in the new volume clouds (IndiniCLOUD).
Before press "Setup Back Layer" button, after inserting the InfiniCLOUD script in the camera and after having pressed the first button
to do the base cloud setup.

NOTE 9: The folders "EXTRA SM DEMOS AND ASSETS" and "EXTRA DEMO ASSETS" from the Sky Master and GI Proxy folders may be deleted or not inserted in the
project to get the Barebone version of Sky Master, to minimize space taken in the project.

NOTE 10: Add the "Conductor" Tag in the project and in any item that would like to receive lightning in a storm.
Add the "Flamer" and "Flammable" tags to use the special FX like propagating fire and ice.





URP SPECIFIC NOTES:

URP SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:

The system has 4 Native URP modules, the Volumetric clouds with 3D Noise and fly through ("InfiniCLOUD_URP" folder), 
the Volumetric clouds with 3D Noise ("InfiniCLOUD_URP" folder), the volumetric fog ("VolumeFogSRP" folder) 
and the sun shafts ("SunShaftsSRP" folder). 

The "InfiniCLOUD" folder contains the Volumetric clouds with 2D Noise system, that is implemented
as a dome with the volumetric shader, thus is not using the native custom renderer feature to render the clouds and can be used with the 3D noise
clouds or standalone as needed. Since the cloud dome is an object in the scene and not image effect, will appear in reflections by default.

To use the URP Native modules:

1. Add the sample "UniversalRP-HighQuality" pipeline from "URP Custom Renderer" -> "Settings", that implements
the sample "ForwardRenderer" custom renderer. This renderer must have the "New Blit Volume Fog SRP", New BlitSun Shafts SRP" and
"New Blit Volume Clouds SRP" renderer feature scripts (if all three are required). Please upgarde the pipeline to 7.3.1 version 
before importing the package and this sample pipeline, so it can function and import properly.

2. Add to the camera the "ConnectSunToSunShaftsURP",  "ConnectSunToVolumeFogURP", "ConnectSunToVolumeCloudsURP" and  "ConnectSunToFullVolumeCloudsURP" scripts 
(or the relevant ones based on which renderer features are in the forward renderer, if choose to use only few of the three),
and regulate the effects as needed, demo scenes with sample settings are provided for reference. Note that those scripts
must be always on camera and enabled, even when a scene does not need the specific effect, so they can control the active renderer features. 
To disable the effect uncheck the "Enable Shafts" for sun shafts or the "Enable Fog" checkboxes for Clouds and Fog, with the scripts enabled.

3. Place the scene directional light in the "Sun" slot of the scripts. This is required for the system to get the sun light information.
The "Sun" must be defined even when the effect is not used (checkbox disabled as described in above section).

NOTE 11: If the system is used with Unity 2020.2 and above, please install the URP 10 to make it work properly.

NOTE 12: 
URP10 Spot Light shadows FIX:
ISSUE: Volumetric lighting is not casting shadows from Spot Light in URP 10 
FIX: In shader "VolumeFogSRP_FORWARD_URP.shader", uncomment the following line

Line 57 - Uncomment to make compatible with URP10
//#define URP10 ////////// ENABLE IF USING URP 10

Should become
#define URP10

NOTE 12a: For URP11, uncomment the relevant #define URP11 and not the #define URP10  

NOTE 13:
Prefabs:
The latest URP Beta includes two main prefabs to drag in the scene, if need to change to other camera note that must be tagged as "MainCamera" and
also all effects and connect scripts must be copied from the prefab camera to that camera, before removing the sample prefab camera from the scene.
An auto configurtator is WIP (like the one in Standard Pipeline that setup the system in an exsting in scene camera)

The prefabs are in the followjng folder:
Assets -> SkyMaster -> Prefabs -> URP
SKY MASTER A (prefab with water and background volume clouds)
SKY MASTER A3 (prefab with water and full volumetric fly through enabled volume clouds)

NOTE 14:
Full volume Clouds with Fly Trough extra blur filter:
In ConnectSunToFullVolumeCloudsURP script on camera, the steps count can trigger a blur filter on the clouds.
You may use this instead of in combination with the Temporal AA effect for reducing cloud noise when lower sampling is used.
Set the steps variable to an even number, in order to enable the filter or to odd to disable it

NOTE 15:
Water refelctions control:
The reflections resolution is set in the camera script "PlanarReflectionsSM_LWRP", in the "Resolution Multiplier" variable.
Also in the same script can control which layers are reflected using the "Reflect Layers" variable.

NOTE 16:
Lightning:
The lightning is enabled using the "LightningCameraVolumeCloudsSM_URP" script, it takes a reference to the skymastermanager
to grab the current weather, so can change the status based on lightning strorm weather. Also references the fullvoluemclouds
script in order to apply the local light to the clouds and references the Lightning prefab that does the actual lightining, 
also a bounding box is passed to the script that defines the bounds where lightning will appear ("Lightning box prefab" slot).

NOTE 17:
Cloud shadows:
The cloud shadows are cast by a plane using a material with the shader "URP 7.3.1 NATIVE SHADOWS GRAPH". When using URP10,
this shader must be replaced with the "URP 7.3.1 NATIVE SHADOWS GRAPH URP10" shader in order to properly cast shadows.
The shadows material settings automation is WIP, currently must be manually tweaked to match the clouds as shown in the demo
materials and scenes. The shader covers all 3 clouds types, using the "Shadow Mode" variable, set to "0" for shadows of
the shader based volume clouds, to "1" for shadows for the background volume clouds and "2" for the latest fly through full volumetric
clouds shadows. Note that the noises and weather texture must also be setup same as in the corresponding clouds script.

NOTE 18: 
If the reflection camera does not render the skybox, toggle the "AllowHDR" checkbox in "connectSunToFullVolumetricCloudsURP" script
when using cloud choice 1. If the volumetric clouds (cloud choice 0) do not render when camera uses HDR, check the "Fastest" checkbox
in the "connectSunToFullVolumetricCloudsURP" script.
